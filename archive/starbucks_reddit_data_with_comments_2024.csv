Its quite literally an ice coffee with cream and sugar - and this corporation has the balls to believe that their basic ass coffee is worth that much.

These prices were obviously ridiculous, but this last increase really made me see how much I waste on Starbucks.

Dear Baristas‚Ä¶ please don‚Äôt be *quite* so condescending if something seems weird ü§£,1720453105.0,860,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1dybz9u/dear_baristas_please_dont_be_quite_so/,218,"Edit- thank you to everyone saying it‚Äôs not a weird request. Not to toot my own horn, but I go out of my way to be nice to my baristas and be a good customer. I call Starbucks customer service to pass along compliments on great service ü§£. As a mom of littles- baristas are some of my favorite people in the world because they hand me a fancy coffee that I didn‚Äôt have to make and I don‚Äôt have to clean up after. You guys are typically a bright spot when I‚Äôm having a rough day! I‚Äôve also worked several customer facing jobs, both retail and food service, so I give a lot of grace if a barista seems in a less than great mood because I get it. Ultimately- if I‚Äôm complaining about an experience it‚Äôs because it really crossed a line üòÇ. 

Context- I‚Äôm a mom of two. I barely slept last night. First thing this morning I had to do a grocery pickup and took my one year old son with me. Since I‚Äôm tired- Starbucks.

The line was super long, WHICH WAS FINE lol. I didn‚Äôt mind just sitting for a few. But my son finished his sippy cup of milk and was throwing an unholy tantrum in the backseat üòÖ. So when it was my turn I ordered my coffee then said I knew it would seem weird but could I get a cup of milk, and is it possible to warm it just a tiny bit so it‚Äôs not ice cold? 

There was a long pause before the barista replied ‚Äúso you want room temperature‚Ä¶ milk?‚Äù. I said yes and briefly explained it‚Äôs for my one year old who‚Äôs throwing a fit. ‚ÄúSo you want to pay Starbucks prices for milk for a baby?‚Äù. At this point I‚Äôm irritated and said obviously I didn‚Äôt love it but I wanted to make my kid happy. ‚ÄúWell why didn‚Äôt you bring milk for him?‚Äù

WTF is with this third degree??? I might be tired but I was nice, I acknowledged it was a weird request, and of course I don‚Äôt want to pay so much for just a single serving of milk for my son and typically I only let him have one cup in the morning but I‚Äôm really tired and want him to stop crying so please for the love of God help em get caffeine in my system and dairy in his üòÇüò©.

I ended up saying never mind on my entire order and just drove away, and ended up grabbing coffee as part of my Target pickup order. But baristas please- if you want to make fun of me behind my back and come somewhere like Reddit and laugh about the mom buying her baby milk at Starbucks you go for it. But to my face just take my order, give me what I asked for, and if something isn‚Äôt possible (slightly warming the milk) just say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry we can‚Äôt do that‚Äù.

Changes the CEO has announced,1730458475.0,694,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1gh2ltf/changes_the_ceo_has_announced/,153,"I've noticed a few posts on this already, but here's a more comprehensive look at the stuff he announced during the Q4 earnings call. He's talked about wanting to fix staffing, make Starbucks truly feel like a third place again, simplify the menu, etc. But until now, he's been pretty quiet on what exactly that means.

He's already announced the elimination of the alternative milk upcharge, and the removal of Oleato and iced energy drinks from the menu. But during the call, he mentioned quite a few other things too:

>We're also making a commitment to grow from within by identifying internal hires for 90% of our retail leadership roles.

\-

>\[W\]e're planning to host a store manager conference in 2025.

\-

>We plan to bring back condiment coffee bars in all our cafes by early 2025.

\-

>We also plan to complete the rollout of our Clover Vertica brewers in all our company-operated locations by the end of fiscal year '25...

\-

>\[W\]e will continue to scale our investment in Siren equipment and Siren Craft processes to improve the in-store experience for our partners and customers.

\-

>So we're working to improve sequencing with a new algorithm that enables on-time mobile order handoffs and supports our four-minute throughput with quality being our goal for cafe customers.

\-

>And over the coming months, we plan to take steps to better separate mobile order pickup from the cafe experience.

\-

>We're also investing in our customers with an intent not to increase menu prices at company-owned and operated stores in North America through fiscal year '25.

\-

>\[W\]e'll begin to prioritize serving coffee in ceramic mugs for customers who choose to enjoy their coffee in our cafes.

\-

>We're also beginning to review and revise our cafe designs to bring back more comfortable seating and amenities and to ensure our stores are a place where customers want to sit, work and eat.

\-

>\[W\]e're reducing the frequency of discount-driven offers that have proven ineffective, diluted our premium positioning, overburdened our baristas and detracted from a consistent customer experience.

\-

>\[W\]e are gonna be piloting some new approaches on how we set up the labor model...



Everything below this are responses to questions during the Q4 earnings call, so they're not so much specific actions, but I think they expand more on what exactly he means by things like ""fix staffing.""



>'\[H\]ey, is there any way to simplify the customization that we provide. Can we put in some guardrails on this, so that it's not out of hand?'

He was phrasing this one as common feedback he heard from baristas. He agreed with it seemingly pretty strongly, saying just before it, ""And so, I couldn't agree more, frankly."" Hopefully that means no more nightmare orders with 100 pumps of insanity.

>I want to make sure that the teams are staffed to win every transaction so that when somebody comes in, they walk away saying they had a great experience time and time again. And I also want to have a scenario where our baristas feel like they have the ability to give a great experience.

\-

>\[B\]y the way, the menu simplification is both in beverage and food.

\-

>And then, I also think we \[need to\] have some pricing architecture tied to guardrails to ensure that we end up with no surprises for, frankly, anybody on what was the price of what they just built. And then also, that we can execute it consistently every time.

\-

>But we are definitely not gonna be moving at the speed you probably saw over the last two years.

I think (hope) this means we won't be seeing any crazy deviations from the soon-to-be-simplified menu anytime soon. They'll still definitely be introducing new drinks, but nothing like the introduction of Oleato.

>The furniture that we have, the materials that we choose. I love \[that\] our designers are talking about making sure we bring back the layers, the texture, the warm\[th of Starbucks\]. Those are the things that are really important.

\-

>We're also after less than four minutes for POS to the handoff.

\-

>\[W\]e're gonna be bringing back to is bringing the Sharpies back to our baristas...

\-

>\[O\]n the mobile order side of things, I want to create a separate area where it's clear, so you know your drink is ready.

\-

>If that store requires a full Siren Craft system, put it in. If it requires some pieces of it, put that in. If it just requires staffing and better deployment, we'll implement that.

\-

>\[W\]e're going to work toward getting less than four minutes in the drive-through window as well.

\-

>\[W\]e're gonna be maniacal about getting after \[that <4 minute metric\].

\-

>And right now, everything has kind of a different price... I think we're surprising people a little bit on what they're paying through the customization process and we've got to fix that.

\-

>And most importantly, I think our barista is \[sic\] gonna be really proud of the store that they work in and the experience that they provide.

Most of these sound like pretty decent changes, except for the fact that he seems dead-set on hitting that <4 minute time everywhere. If you're curious, he mentioned it fifteen (15) times during the call.

At one point, he says, ""'\[T\]he customer experience will not exceed that of the partners' experience."" But then he turns around and wants to implement a literal timer on everything saying that he's going to be, ""maniacal"" about hitting it. It seems entirely antithetical and utterly out of touch.

There‚Äôs things like the Global Farmer Fund which provides loans to farmers so they can plant new trees, improve infrastructure on their farms, get new equipment, etc. Our Farmer Support Centers provide access to free education and resources to show farmers what is being done with soil testing, fertilization techniques, planting techniques, everything to be able to produce disease resistant, fruit bearing trees to maximize yields for the farmers, and the farmers get to learn all of these things for free. We‚Äôve even extended over to training farmers in China and have over 1,000 C.A.F.E. verified coffee farms over there. The goal is to be able to take coffee farmers, who are traditionally impoverished, and bring them out of poverty so they can own and operate successful farms that supply coffee globally without having to worry how they‚Äôll make ends meet. So like we do do quite a lot, and for that alone, even from the customer end, I was more than happy to buy more expensive bags of coffee.

Thankfully my store has the screen where we can mark off which individual items have been handed out which makes it easier IF it is kept up with, but a lot of stores still have the older screens that just show whether the order is gone or not. Because of this, a lot of baristas will keep the order on the payment screen to show that the order that was just paid for is still the one at the window. So let‚Äôs say car 1 pays for car 2‚Äôs order, so car 2‚Äôs order is the one showing it was paid. Now a barista can come over, either to help or covering a break, and assume because car 2 is showing paid on the payment screen and the car that was at the window is leaving, and a new car is rolling up, that the car should be receiving car 3‚Äôs items at car 3‚Äôs price. Taking names in the drive thru can help alleviate this confusion because you know James order shouldn‚Äôt go to Alex, but many baristas don‚Äôt get names and many more customers refuse to give a name.\n\n2) Tipping. Lots of people in pay in forward lines feel like their generous deed is already being done, so they do not tip. Sometimes people will cover multiple cars behind them (say like 3) and now that means 4 people aren‚Äôt tipping, whereas before, maybe those people would have thrown us a dollar. A lot of people don‚Äôt carry cash anymore, so if those people aren‚Äôt given the pin pad at all, then we‚Äôre out that tip. The people in the drive thru are all still paying money, they‚Äôre not really saving a significant amount, the only person who really benefits is the person who finally breaks it.\n\n3) Drive thru times.

$3 grande deal fail and I want to cry,1715803930.0,557,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1csuj3f/3_grande_deal_fail_and_i_want_to_cry/,151,"I‚Äôm having a bad day (I‚Äôm 6mo PP and very emotional all the time so please be nice üò≠).

I buckled my daughter in her car seat, made the drive to my nearest Starbucks, and went through the drive thru. Showed the cashier my app for the deal she scanned my app - but then right after said, ‚Äúoh, I‚Äôm sorry I charged the full price..‚Äù. I just said it was okay and took my drink.

No drinks during opening?,1713214274.0,398,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1c4x7ps/no_drinks_during_opening/,147,"We just got a new store manager who is VERY by-the-book. She's implementing all of Starbucks' policies to a T (one minute late? that's a warning) and while none of it has gone over particularly well, the one that just seems absolutely ridiculous to me is that **openers are no longer allowed to have drinks until their first break, 2 hours into their shift...** Is this normal?

SM states this is because Starbucks' policy is that baristas may only mark out drinks on break or lunch, or 30 minutes before or after a shift. They also cannot make their own drinks. Since openers cannot arrive 30 minutes early, and we would also have to make our own drink (or... make each others' drinks I guess?), we are no longer allowed to have drinks until our first break. I kind of feel like asking me to wake up at 3:30 am (our store opens at 4:30, we're there at 4:00 am) to come open your coffee shop and serve coffee to the community while also telling me I can't have a cup of coffee is... insane?

I understand wanting to ensure the policies are implemented fairly and all team members are treated equally, but I just can't imagine baristas from other day parts ever arguing against openers getting drinks.

TL;DR New SM says no drinks for openers until their first break. Is this a correct implementation of Starbucks policy?

-------

**UPDATE 2**: In case anyone ever comes across this post, here‚Äôs the resolution: As of 5/1, openers and closers at our store are both allowed to mark out drinks before/ after their shifts respectively!!! 
New SM went to new DM (also an outside hire) who apparently ‚Äúinterpreted the rule the same way,‚Äù so SM then called PCC and after a few days of back-and-forth, was advised the rule is to be implemented ‚Äúat SM‚Äôs discretion.‚Äù SM ultimately said ‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs up to me, I don‚Äôt care if you guys get drinks during those shifts‚Äù and that was the end of it‚Ä¶ except that in true Starbucks fashion she‚Äôs also already quit lmao (she got a state job though, so good for her) so we‚Äôll see what the next SM decides ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Having so much fun calling people out.,1711726865.0,392,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1bqsd4j/having_so_much_fun_calling_people_out/,58,"I'm not an employee at Starbucks, nor am I a huge fan. I love their food, not their prices, so I don't go often. We all know by now about the Boycott. So many people said ""I'll never shop at Starbucks again"" ""Cup of blood, I could never"", etc. Well a few months later, to absolutely no one's surprise, all these people are back at Starbucks.

Stopped at my university Starbucks and saw a girl there who not even two months ago was saying she'd never shop at Starbucks again. Posting EVERYDAY, CONSTANTLY about the war and specifically about how Starbucks is a HUGE part of the problem. She called me out a while back for drinking it, to which I responded ""It's a trendy thing and you'll all be back in a few weeks."" or something along those lines.

She got mad of course but I wasn't wrong. We hadn't talked much until I saw her. All the girls who were saying they'd never go back, are all either posting their cups on Snapchat/Instagram or drinking it in secret like this girl I'm talking about. I walked up to her and said ""Cup of blood, eh?"" and she responded in a laughy, embarrassed way. We made a little small talk and I walked away and said ""Enjoy your coffee"" and I could see the disdain on her face.

If you want to boycott, go ahead, but treating it like a trend and getting mad when people call you out on doing so is embarrassing behavior. This is not the first time I've had interactions like this in the past month. It's been fun but also really sad because these were the same people sending death threats to people a few weeks ago for doing the same thing they're doing now...","[{'comment_body': ""I know this wasn't the point of the post, but prices are going up again on April 1st"", 'comment_score': 299, 'comment_created_utc': 1711728282.0}, {'comment_body': 'you aren‚Äôt wrong. i have so many people who have told me they could never support such a horrible company and would never be back, and what would you know, they were back the next morning lol.', 'comment_score': 73, 'comment_created_utc': 1711727420.0}, {'comment_body': 'performative activism is so tiring. donate or volunteer with local support groups or something instead of shaming and threatening people‚Ä¶', 'comment_score': 178, 'comment_created_utc': 1711728484.0}, {'comment_body': 'I don‚Äôt even think Starbucks needs to be boycotted but damn if you‚Äôre gonna go hard go hard.

Tips from a Barista to YOU ü´µ,1716399399.0,343,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1cy672x/tips_from_a_barista_to_you/,52,"For all customers excited about Memorial Day weekend, just know us baristas are shitting ourselves. This isn't a ""don't come in bc we hate you"" post, so don't worry! These are just tips for anyone coming in to help expedite your experience and keep our lines moving for YOUR benefit. Trust me, we appreciate the lines moving faster but it mostly benefits you! 
1. Make sure your app is open and ready to go while you're in line. If the line is long, this is your best opportunity to get the order(s) together, pick out what you want, and have your app ready. We can even scan first! Just because you have the app doesn't mean you have to pay with the app, so use Scan & Pay and Scan Only as needed. 
2. Just because you mobile ordered doesn't mean it's faster than waiting in line. Not for this scenario anyway, because that's everyone else's thoughts too. If you still want to mobile order, because the wait time will likely be the same, allow some extra time before you pick it up. Or kick back and enjoy the a/c and wait inside if you can. 
3. Account for your plans. We will be very VERY busy country-wide, so it is not our fault that you're late to your function. We work as fast as we reasonably can, and it's impossible to sift through all of the tickets without messing our routine up. If you have plans at 1pm, don't arrive at 12:50 and place an order unless the store is dead. We will not have it ready in time, unfortunately. You still can order, but there's no promise it'll be expedient.
4. Ask for water and pup cups at the register! Unless specified by your state, water and pup cups ARE free! But if you ask for one after you order, it throws back the routine. Yes, they are easy to make, but it will still throw the routine off kilter and you will have to wait longer. It is much easier to order at the register, so make sure to add that in! There's no penalty if you forget to ask, we won't berate you for asking at the hand-off if it slips your mind! But don't come in and order at the hand-off, even if it's just a water. For Mobile customers, if you don't want to ask for a water at the register you can put your name and add ""+ venti water"" to it in the app. We can add the water to your order that way while it's being made. You get your water and you're good to go! 
5. Double and Triple star days need you to activate the offer before you do anything else, so activate that bad boy before you get to the register, we may forget to double-check with you. If you're redeeming points at the register, let us know! You don't have to hit any redeem options if you're ordering in person, that's our job! 
6. If you need sugar, cream/milk, straws, plastic ware or anything on the side then please ask! Unless your store has it all out (which I applaud them for not getting in trouble for it), we aren't allowed to have anything out for customer use. We're also not allowed to ask or assume. YOU have to tell us what YOU need. It's a rule that I find ridiculous, but it's a rule nonetheless. Of course if you forget we will have no problem getting you what you need, but it'll save some headache for you if you ask up front. 
7. The higher priced the drink is, chances are that means it'll take longer. Not exactly right every time, but if you have a lot of modifications to your drink then that's more steps to go through. If you order a frappuccino, especially one of the layered ones, they take a lot of steps and will take more time! It may seem obvious, but a reminder never hurts. 

Some baristas may have more things to keep in mind and might comment some ideas below, keep an eye out if you're interested. I am not telling you how to order anything at Starbucks, you order however you want! I do want everyone to be able to have a pleasant time in our stores, customers and partners alike. Sometimes just making things less complicated is enough to give someone a better day. Thank you for taking the time to read, please be kind as we are all so very fragile in these times.

Finally, I asked him how to spell his name. After he paid, he flamboyantly said, ""that was traumatic, so there's no tip coming from me!"" The lady he was with just laughed. 

Was it just me, or was that really rude? First of all, I couldn't care less if you don't tip. I don't blame anyone for not tipping at Starbucks, the prices here have become ridiculous and one person not tipping is really barely going to affect me at all. It's not like a dine-in restaurant where the server runs ragged for people while making less than minimum wage, and then the people still don't tip. That's really crappy, but at Starbucks it's not like that. 

But why would someone say that? If you don't want to leave a tip, just don't leave a tip, you don't have to announce it to everyone around. That's just rude and disrespectful.

Teenagers coming in and purposely ordering the wrong size?,1712003135.0,294,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1btemdg/teenagers_coming_in_and_purposely_ordering_the/,52,"Was curious if this was a common occurrence...

This past Saturday I had some work to do so I went to Starbucks to get it done. As I was sitting there doing my work these two young girls, (probably 13 and 15) ordered tall pink drinks. When their orders were done and the barista called it out they said something along the lines of ""Uhh we ordered a tall, the big one, not the small one."" They said it somewhat in a mocking tone and the poor barista explained to them that they actually ordered a small size, not a large. They just sorta stared blankly at him with this annoyed look and he reminded them the size info and kindly remade their drinks. When he gave it to them they giggled and grabbed the drinks without a thank you. 

I used to be a barista a while back at Starbucks and I remember old men getting confused about the starbuck talls v.s beer talls. I had no issue remaking them in those instances cause they were often apologetic about it and it didn't happen that often.
