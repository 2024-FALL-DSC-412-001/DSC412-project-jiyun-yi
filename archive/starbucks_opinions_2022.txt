Yes there is a price jump and yes I’m pretty sure it just started today. Today was a terrible day for me to be on drive through my whole shift 🙄 

I know Starbucks makes more than enough to give all their employees higher wages but the truth of the matter is, the higher ups are greedy and don’t wanna sacrifice their million dollar bonuses. So they jackup the prices and blame it on paying the baristas. 

With that in mind please, PLEASEEEEE, don’t harass your baristas about it. We literally can not do anything about the prices in our systems. 😰
I had a woman complain in my DT for 5 minutes and I kept trying to stay positive, “sorry! That’s above my pay grade though nothing I can do, it is unfortunate though.” And she kept going. What does she expect me to do? Go out to dinner with corporate and give them a compelling argument on why they shouldn’t?
when customers complain about the prices like i’m a secret agent from corporate who has any influence whatsoever 💀
Literally was so frustrating !! Like pls I don’t think it’s right for a grande iced coffee to be $4.07  either but I’m not seeing any benefits from it either. B
when i seen the brown sugar shaken espresso was 7.06 for a grande i almost choked
You know what’s also annoying, on the drive thru screen they show the order price before tax… it’s awesome
Custies: Oh my god its getting so expensive!!! $6.00 for a coffee??? Seriously??? That's ridiculous >:(

Me: I agree! Please feel free to let corporate know, they don't listen to us much :)

usually shuts them down pretty quick. not only is it an ever-so-slightly passive aggressive reminder that its out of our control and we hear the complaint plenty, but its also a psychological trick. 

Lets them know we hear them, understand their complaint, and we do, in fact, agree with them. There really isn't anywhere else for them to go from there, which is usually what shuts them down (unless they're having an already bad day and want to be particularly nasty). At that point though, their bad mood is no longer my problem. Ive done what I can do.
I got coffee today and didn’t even notice (then again I wasn’t really paying attention). Is it on everything?
It did start today. I’m in NYC and my drink went up about 10%. I already only get a triple espresso because everything is too expensive. This will help me reduce my habit
I only wish we were told ahead if time so we weren't caught off gaurd when a regular asks why the price is wrong, it just makes us baristas look dumb
… on top of inflation there’s been growing issues world wide due to global warming and the coffee belt is in trouble. The supply of coffee is being choked causing prices to also go up… since coffee plants take a few years to mature.
Also the extra prices for blending certain drinks or certain requests
Ahh I wondered why my grande vanilla sweet cream cold brew jumped from $4.81 to $5.13 today.
it’s so pathetic they got rid of our free drink a day benefit, they have the money
My MDR went from $4.83 to $5.16 to now $5.43.  Definitely an incentive to cut back.
I noticed last night when I ordered my usual mango dragonfruit lemonade and it was over $6 for the first time ever ☹️
It was already really hard to justify my $6.10 grande, anymore and I really don’t know how I can afford to keep going to Starbucks 😔
Putting out the new food tags in the pastry case and seeing the price jumps like 👀 oof I’m glad I get this stuff for free
I’m at sbux now and got a venti cold brew and it was 4.75. I think before it was 4.45.  😠
“I raised the price just for you sweetie”
The most I’ll pay for my daily “coffee” is $7.50, if it becomes $7.51 you’re gonna be hearing about it.
I just wish they would tell us before hand so we aren’t all caught off guard when customers start asking etc
I’m in Thailand, where I’m positive that the staff did not receive raises, and the price of a latte went from 135 baht to 140 baht. It’s a world wide thing.
Yeah.. we had a lady complain that her venti mango dragonfruit refresher price wasn't 5.05 anymore after her cup discount. In addition to this, she also went on to complain that she was supposed to get 10% off of her drink and not just 10 cents from the cup discount.

So not only did the overall price increase, but this entire time thought she was getting 10% off of her drinks instead of 10 cents.. somehow. Mind you by the way, this lady only ever comes in for a venti mango dragonfruit refresher. My shift had to get involved as well as my manager, so she held up the DT line for a good 6 -7 minutes because she just blatantly assumed the wrong information and refused to listen even after we explained multiple times that not only did our prices increase, but the discount was never 10% it was always 10 cents.  


Edit: We ended up giving the next car in line a $4 recovery card just because we felt bad for how long they had to wait because of her.
I still ask myself:

Why do customers STILL come to Starbucks if the prices continue to go up?!?! Instead of complaining about the prices, you can stop going to Starbucks! 

Is it really worth it to have a shaken espresso for over $7?
I'm basically done with Starbucks. I was so pissed when they recently stopped doing the thing where if you buy coffee/beans at the grocery store you can text a picture of your receipt and you get stars toward rewards.  I was honestly just sticking around for the rewards. Without that what's the point of staying loyal? Time to go check out all the independent coffee shops instead.
Funny how big corporations keep jacking prices and saying it’s inflation, but a local family owned restaurant in my town hasn’t changed their prices in 10 years, and they’re not hurting whatsoever.
I just bought a grande chocolate foam CB for $5.85, plus $2 tip I always give. Fucking ridiculous!!  I’m honestly about to buy a 5 lb bag of SB CB beans on eBay and make it my damned self.
I tell them it’s not going into our pockets and that they can take that as they will, since, well, it isn’t.
my croissant went up by 30 cents smh 🤦‍♂️
I can’t believe they keep raising the prices. This is the second time this year. Right now I’m paying what used to cost a venti for a grande😑.
My short latte with modifications is like $7
Insane, but what can you do?
I noticed this morning when I ordered my flat white. Went up about 35 cents (NYC) to poke over $6 for the first time. I ordered via mobile, so I saw the checkout price and figured oh okay, guess that increase happened. But hey, I had just left my therapist's office and was heading to work, so I wanted this little thing for me.
Everyone just needs to boycott Starbucks and just go to other coffee stores. No offense to the baristas but Starbucks corporate and some managers just need to lose their jobs and be blacklisted from ever working in coffee ever again.
Oh yay…
So recently my city put through a new “environmental” bylaw saying that companies must charge 25c per cup and the company gets to keep this extra revenue to put towards being more sustainable. With absolutely no oversight. Some companies lowered their price to account for the cup fee (essentially eating the cost). 

Well guess what billion dollar chain implemented and gets to keep the entire 25c price hike…

Oh also it’s a mandatory 15c per paper bag (no plastic) as well. This is applicable towards any fast food so all the huge corps out here have a built in profit hike.
If you can't be bothered to make your own coffee it's gonna cost you. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Apparently there’s a food shortage happening/coming. Especially from foods imported from third world countries. So of course coffee, sugar, fruits, chocolate is on that list. So their prices have inflated. And a recession is also apparently happening soon. Overall I’m getting very anxious.

But I just wanted to mention this so if your customers do ask, you can have some sort of your own explanation.
The customer who complains to a barista about rising prices is the same derp who insists that capitalism is the best system. I’m sure they complain about hating Monday’s, too.
If people have a problem with the price then just stop buying. Starbucks knows they can do this because people let them get away with it. If people stopped buying that would hurt Starbucks' bottom line(what they actually care about) and then they'll actually have to make changes.

\- Former Starbucks Barista

P.s. I'm pretty sure this is just Starbucks being Starbucks. Others places I think it's just greed, inflation, and price gouging.
I truly despise ppl like that, how are you that dense to think a single employee.. of a multi billion dollar company, has the power to change prices?
I love the baristas but the price hikes were finally the step too far for me; that and discontinuing basically all of the sugar free options. I ordered the syrups and bought an espresso machine and now I’m my own barista.
Take. And don't feel bad about it.
What I don’t understand is that hole the prices keep going up it seems like the Trenta size is usually unaffected. Now iced coffee in my area is $3.75 grande, $3.95 venti; and $4.25 Trenta. 50 cents more to double your size from grande to Trenta.
Yep vanilla sweet cream venti went up 20 cents smh
yeah people are being charged for double blending sooo it’s a whole thing at my store lol
Another reason why I will never quit my job at Starbucks even if I get a full time job. I could never go back to paying full price for these drinks especially if the prices keep going up every quarter. I can’t believe I even spent the amount of money I did before I even worked with the siren *shudders*
Had someone earlier today order a grande coffee frap with 3 shots and oat milk their total for that one drink was $9.25 or so. It was literally so mind boggling that that one drink was nearly $10. Personally I think add shots should only be $50 at most, it’s insane!!
"Yeah I wouldn't pay that much" is my go-to when people complain about prices.
My response is “I just show up with my apron”
Third price raise since they promised us raises. The raises not coming until august 🙃
I remember working when coffee was 2.41 for a venti medium Roast. Oh how times change
exactly we can’t do anything so they shouldn’t take it out on us
First time I stopped at the Starbucks drive-through in months. I ordered a tall black cold brew and I came out to $3.95. I’ll admit that I said “oh shit” because the last time I got a black cold brew I remember paying about $2.5. Not gonna complain about it, but I laughed when the barista responded. I know y’all don’t have control over the prices.
[removed]
I’ll give you an even bigger tip than normal. You are the scapegoat. The lowest are always the scapegoat- which is most of us

And the lowest are all of us and we manage to keep eachother afloat.
Where EXACTLY did I get angry?
I guess this is my hint to kick the strawberry açai refresher lemonades. I was kinda shocked when I went by this evening and the price had jumped 42¢ for a venti size of it. It doesn't seem like much in the grand scheme of things, especially since I get one once a week at best, but that's still a bit of a shock given the last jump was maybe about 20¢ earlier this year

If anyone who works at Starbucks could give me an idea of if it'd be possible to make this at home somehow or if any competitors have a pretty similar drink that'd potentially be cheaper then I'd appreciate it a lot. That drink is literally the only reason I honestly hit up Starbucks
They need some kind of a “monthly pass” like Panera has.  For about $12 inclusive of tax you can get effectively unlimited hot and iced coffee and some other beverages at any Panera in the US.  $4.05 for a medium black iced coffee is insane when not that long ago they were like $2.65.
Simply call Howard Schultz and explain the situation, I’m sure he will be understanding and decrease prices
You have a dial in back and you can turn the prices down whenever you want
Ha ha, my experience.

Customer: listen you little knucklehead, that t-shirt doesn't cost that much. (Yep, a customer actually said the same sentence in 2011).


Me: Sir, afterall a worker here, you think I own this store with these prices per t-shirt and look this miserable?
$4.07? Holy shit, what state are you located in? I quit in 2020 and it was under 3$
Wow a venti is 2.97 I’m California. I thought that was high.
Don't feel sorry for the iced coffee heads. They could make it at home for literal pennies. They're in Starbucks by choice.
It’s 4.05 for a tall in my city, Northern California
Holy crap, in the US? I just checked the app and it's $5.75 for a grande for me
But wait untill they get it w/ VSC!! #KAching  💰💰
We had our screens updated and it shows tax plus any additional charges for modifications.
Good response but I hated having this or similar interactions multiple times a shift and I just wanted to scream ‘you’re the 12 person today who brought this shit up, you aren’t stunning and brave for sticking up for yourself to the barista at Starbucks because your coffee is slightly more expensive’
No, prices go up every quarter but they stagger what increases.
They mentioned the bending increase in the Sumer training, i just assumed everything else would too
I'm sorry nobody told you before, but they do raise prices on different drinks every launch. So if a new launch happens (which you can see on the weekly updates and, I believe, my daily), expect random drinks to be more expensive
I mean it was in all of the training, plus we get sent signage before launch which includes all of the food+drink price changes.
That and it takes 5 trees to make one pound of roasted coffee. A fully mature tree takes 3-5 years to grow. That's 25 trees just for the 5lbs of pike we use for the urns. And 100 trees per box of pike.

That and the coffee Starbucks chooses is only an insanely small portion of all the growers, so that and the smaller coffee zone makes it more expensive as well. And, unfortunately, the amount of coffee the planet drinks, it is quite literally driving the coffee business into the ground because we are currently drinking it faster than it is being grown.

Another note, a lot of coffee farms do not exist anymore because of covid. So we don't even have as many growers as we used to.
I believe they rolled this one out because of all the tiktok drinks. To be fair, blending iced coffees can get annoying. But Starbucks clearly makes enough money already 🙄
Them cents tho.
Umm say what now?
lol i’ve never had that. not even while working do we get a free drink
Wait. I haven’t been a partner for 15 years now, but you guys don’t get free drinks while working anymore??
Honestly me too. I can get a $3 lemonade ice tea from Tim Hortons and be just as happy.
I’ve started making my own coffee at home too. Way cheaper for sure. 1 jar of instant coffee cost me about $6 and it looks like it’ll last me a couple months. I bought my own flavor syrup on Amazon for about $12 and it’s lasted me like 2 months. And milk is what costs the most. I get a bottle of oat milk for like $5 that lasts about a week.
it changed (at least in my area) from 4.45 to 4.75 with the winter launch
It blows me away that people can afford to come by and drop $14 on a mediocre breakfast sandwich and one elaborate coffee, *every single day*.
When I started working my first corporate office job 16 years ago I budgeted five dollars a day for my fancy coffee. At that point it actually cost $3.85 and I put the rest in the tip jar. I continued to do this up until the price exceeded five dollars. Then it was a sad sad day and I had to switch to making my own or buying the pre-made iced coffee from the grocery store. Someone recently gifted me a Starbucks gift card so I decided to treat myself and get a fancy coffee. It was over seven dollars. But I know that the people in the stores making my coffee are not in charge of making the prices so all I did was wish them a good day and went on my way
We don’t control the prices. You’d just be harassing an underpaid barista for something they can’t do anything about, which is incredibly rude.
while her misunderstanding is simply a mistake, the fact that she held up the line so long is a blatant indication of her lack of self awareness. Good on you guys for giving the next car over a gift card, that sounds miserable 🤍
That $4 recovery card now pays for a partial drink! 😂
Nope, it is not worth it. Once I graduate in a few days, no more Starbucks for me. Just not worth the price!
I'm a cold brew + milk person, but I've slowed down on my visits after the last price hike for cold brew and will probably finish out my last card reload now and be done for a while. I kept going because I was willing to pay the extra for the convenience factor. However, there is a value limit to convenience for me, and now that a venti cold brew with nothing fancy has crossed the $5 mark after tax that's my cue to switch to home methods.
They sell the CB beans I didn't know that just bought a cold brew maker to cut down on my daily trips. I will still go on occasion but knowing the beans are out there is awesome.
Best way to go my friend! Started making my own DIY Starbucks drinks at home. I have my pour over and Nespresso they get the job fairly done. I’m aware people love the grab and go concept. But we should stop and think if it’s worth it for our pockets in the long run. I guarantee if people stop buying and making their own cups of joe at home then we will see how quick they are to drop those prices in the long haul. Same with the chip shortage for cars. Unfortunately many people - young adults to be exact are purchasing cars they can’t afford. Especially at this time now….
I’ve just been making iced coffee at home with a press overnight. It’s getting really out of hand with these prices. It’s becoming an every once in a while thing now versus every week
stop getting starbucks
It really is a mood-booster for me. A lil treat if you’ve had (or are in anticipation of having) a long day. It’s all relative. I could be indulging my Sephora urges but here I am only spending $7. ⭐️
Someone recently left a note on our door complaining about something and said they were going to email Howard personally lmfao
This reminds me of the Kris Jenner quote "What would happen if you just called Taylor up?" loool. But honestly, what was she expecting??
I’ll be sure to seduce him or something 😭
We used to always jokingly say we were going to call Howie
BAHAHAHAH

Never worked at bux but wish I'd had this retort for when the customers complained about the insane prices at my last job
we cant even adjust the thermostat how do they expect us to be able to control prices
*cries in Canadian*
$4.25 for an iced coffee in Seattle :(
Where in California is it $2.97? It’s $4.25 for a venti iced coffee in SoCal lol
LOL omg no in canada (ontario)
Some of the more popular/ more busy areas in the US have different prices.
7.06 CAD is only 5.45 USD so turns out it's actually cheaper here.
Or Chocolate cold foam.   Not a fan.  It has a weird after after taste.
>bending 

TIL baristas are Coffee Benders
And i think it was in one of the weekly updates too, but i could be wrong about that.
I'm a 243, im well aware of how price increases work each quarter, what I'm saying is when youre going fast and 60-80% of your custies are regulars who get rhe exact same thing for the exact same cost every day, it makes you stop and reset and throws off your flow, it would just be nice if we knew exactly what was going up each time
Training??!? I did spring training 45 days AFTER spring launch LOL
Yup. You a roaster?
i said what i said. i know that it was just a covid benefit but they are such a huge corporation and allowing us a free drink everyday wasn’t an issue for them, they should have let us keep it
Oh no honey, you get free drinks half an hour before and half an hour after your shift, and all during. That’s company policy and if your manager doesn’t let you, then report them.
do you work licensed or corporate?
we still get unlimited free drinks while working! but during covid we used to also got a free drink and free food item on our days off, it was really nice honestly i miss it so much.

there was talk about them possibly making it permanent, but they didn’t… idk why 😭
Holy shit. I'm moving to Canada
The shocker is, that they can't afford it. There is a reason the vast majority of this country doesn't have $1,000 in savings, crippling credit card debt, etc.
I didn’t think a /s was needed. But I guess I was wrong.
Yeah we wouldn't have minded it nearly as much if she were to just admit that it was a misunderstanding but she just kept insisting that she was supposed to be getting 10% off and held up the line over it. People really just hate being told they're wrong even when they're faced with proof of it. We give her the receipt for her order every time she comes to per her request-- LOL
Starbucks claims to have higher prices because of the quality, inflation, and giving benefits for the employees. But realistically, the extra money is going to the CEOs and they act like they can’t pay us a living wage.
I got an espresso set up at home and never looked back. Once I priced out either getting coffee at Starbucks or dunkin, and/or fetting nespresso pods, I realized it was way cheaper to get a nice machine, and get beans that I like. Now I make a drink, put it in a jar, and pour it over ice when I’m ready for it. It’s awesome.
I neglected to mention I work there, sorry 😅 this is the price I see before marking out a drink I get for free. But still, I see my regulars multiple times a day. I have no idea how they afford it. I know many of them are not fancy people.
Emailing CEOs can be surprisingly effective.

Not for this shit, though.
Starbucks sugar daddy?? 😳
Wait, what? We've got some control at our store. It's only a range of a few degrees, but it's still an amount of control.
i live in norcal and if im remembering correctly our venti iced coffee is like 4.25 and the grande is in the 3s? i could be wrong
Laughs in *partner beverage* but also i haven't worked since Saturday when did the prices go up??
Ditto in The Bay.
You’re right I realized that’s after partner discount
ah so monopoly money
Huh $6.25 before tax (6.56 after) for the grande shaken brown sugar. On the other coast 👋
I feel so bad for the folks who legit get the same thing. I knew the sandwiches were going up because I checked the new display cards (Canada) but it threw me off guard when espresso macchiato guy in the morning was like… “the price increased?” And I’m like… “oh it must have! We just had a new launch. Sometimes prices increase” and he goes on to be like “30 cent increase” 

It does make us look a little stupid. Like oh… yeah guess the prices did go up 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️ 

There was a time in my district where prices of drip coffee varied from one store to the next and we were all within walking distance in the downtown core. So bizarre.
Hell fucking no. Hopefully one day as I want to move up in the company! But Im just your regular barista that went into the coffee academy 🥰
Oh I thought you were talking about the free drinks while we’re working benefit, I’d’ve lost my shit lol
Wow I guess I had been missing out on free drinks, nobody ever told me...
We used to get a free drink every day? Honestly it’s good we don’t for the sake of my health because my favourite drink is the iced shaken espresso…..
https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1wba3y/it_sucks_to_be_licensed/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
i don’t think so ): we’re watched like a HAWK and they get on us so often with stuff like this
licensed, which is why, but it sucks bc we have all the same items and none of the benefits
they did, but applicable at your home store only and the food markout counts as one of your 7 weekly food markouts
Oh okay. That sucks they discontinued that though. It’s not like Starbucks can’t afford it.
Things are way more expensive in Canada though but it’s worth it 😣
That and avocado toast
I think they were playing along.
Fuck it, I’ve been gone from there long enough, I’ll take one for the team.
i was exaggerating a little, we can also change it but only a few degrees and in my mind a few degrees is nothing in this heatttt
It’s $3.75 here in SoCal 😖
Today along with Summer 1 launch. I marked out an iced coffee yesterday and the price was $3.45, mobile ordered one today and it’s $3.75
With the new launch today, I'm guessing.
Gotcha! I was gonna say, I wish it was $2.97 for a venti like the good ol days 🤣
Lol.
At my old job (not starbucks) the nearest location had a senior’s discount but we didn’t. We were open on holidays and most other close locations were not. We got so many angry seniors complaining about the lack of discount and I just had to be like “sorry idk why it’s like that but I can’t change it….” It’s frustrating when things vary like that at close locations
I mean, I do it for fun. I just live down the road from  one of the largest plants for Starbucks.
OMG NO i literally would quit if that were the case
I'd quit immediately 😂🤚
It went away in October, I believe
Rip I’m so sorry, tbh if you can find a better job I think everyone should give up being a bean slave. The job sucks as it but franchise really gets done extra dirty.
That response is definitely a "I missed the sarcasm" response.
Truly an OG 🤝
our store’s customer connection is low bc the old people are upset we can’t give them discounts 🙄
Let’s all just quit
I want Starbucks to personally just hold a virtual meeting with me so they can just say fuck you to my face already
I got yelled at by our 3rd customer of the day 😍 l simply told her it was too early to be screaming  and to take it up with Kevin
Remember last year when they told us they didn’t have enough money to lay us off with pay, then executed a 300mil stock buyback? I remember. They changed their minds on paying us, but that was the moment I decided to quit. So glad to be gone
Are they just jacking up the prices with every launch now? I thought the last increase was bad enough, I can’t believe they took it another step further
The store (not Starbucks) where I work, I saw all their meat (beef) and deli meats go up 1+ a pound in the deli, and 3+ per pound in the meat department.  


No salary increases.. and I have access to buyer reports, the costs didn't increase they did it because they could.
My drink jumped 22 cents.... thank got I got that partner discount cause goddamn.
I'm turning off my autoload in my app, using my points, running through my gift cards, and saying adios to Starbucks.  My no-sugar iced green tea is now nearly $4 with tax.  NOPE.
Yup I had 2 people ask about it today. One was pissed.
This is why people using “but then prices will go up!” as the excuse to not raise wages. Like wake up, they’re gonna raise prices either way.
Yup. My coworker caught in the POS system and we were all like WTF.
As a customer, I would like the same. At this point, these prices are fucking UNGODLY
there are 86 locations getting high priority raises in january. i believe the other locations will be getting raises by summer. 

guess the price increase is to pay for that? because hEaVeN forbid one of our board members make less this year than they did last year (you know, like the rest of us whose wages haven’t kept up with inflation for the past 40 years)
Yup. Noticed it today too.

I usually get same thing every morning before school - tall hot latte and venti hot tea. A few months ago it was around 4.08$, yesterday it was 4.60$, today it was 5.00$ 

Noticed something was odd today, but didn’t think much about it. Now reading this and seeing that yep, prices increase. Even with my 30% off it’s still too much! 

Starbucks, dear, you’re missing half of your fucking inventory, why are you raising prices for already pissed customers?
$12.50 to start in Arizona. Costco hires at $19 to check receipts. Salad N Go is $15 to literally put cold salads in a box. But you know, benefits.
bro wtf .. why does my TALL caramel macchiato cost almost $5 ..
BUTTTTT... "fOoD cOsTs ArE gOiNg Up BeCaUsE sTaFfInG cOsTs ArE gOiNg Up"
It's getting to the point I almost want to apologize to some of our customers for how much they're getting charged. If I'm paying that much for a drink, there better be alcohol in it.
They said they’re raising to $15/hr for baristas and $18/hr for SSVs by summer and until then, this month they’ll be adjusting pay or everyone that got the past raises but didn’t receive a difference based on their years of promotion/raises.
Yepp, so corporate keeps making more money as drink prices increase but our wages stay the same🙃
Bring back cocaine at this point
I was shocked this morning when I rung up a bagel with cream cheese and noticed that cream cheese is 95¢ now, which is ridiculous considering that we're switching over to the 1oz Philadelphia ones at some point.
I told my manager I had an offer for 18.70 and she was able to get me a raise to 14.50!
I say this all the time 😭 I mentioned it to a cool customer once in drive and he tipped extra after hearing that we don’t get raises with the price jumps.
Those yachts and private planes for the upper execs aren’t going to pay for themselves.
I think are wages are going up soon… in my area we are paid 14.75 but with minimum wage going up are store is expected to jump to 15.75
I found out when I rang up a grande Pike add syrup and it was $4.00!
Yeah my drink order is changing because I’m not paying $7 for anything
Anyone in Greensboro NC know the pay there? I am looking to move
Starbucks increases prices at least twice a year, but they do it across different drinks and sizes, so it's harder to track.

For example, notice how when the PSL releases, it's almost always with prices increases on drinks, but the "media" will almost never touch on the price increases, because they're all pretending to care about the PSL being out.

It's been this way since under Howard Schultz's "leadership", at the very least. Kevin Johnson is following the very same established path. No difference.
I was getting my usual order and as I was about to check out, I noticed it was $7 with tax and was sooo confused. I switch over to pike roast w 2 mocha just so I can still feel something and save some money… but damn.
2+ year partners are getting 5% raise 

5+ year partners are getting 10% 

With ssv going up to 19-23$
i got bitched at like a million times today over price changes. it’s kind of ridiculous how expensive our drinks are tbh and i understand the frustration from the customer’s end but i hate getting yelled about it. LIKE I DONT MAKE THE PRICES
I like how they do the increase in price kinda at the same time when they do yearly increases in wages, so they can have all of us as a reason of the increased prices. Not showing the sole purpose of their business; to achieve higher revenues each year
Which drinks price increased?
In canada we got an increase starting Dec 27th. Went up about 6%. Shitty the states aren't doing it too.
I mean I still get coffee for free. That's most of my paycheck right there :P
I thought Starbucks was ahead of the curve with their $2.95 chocolate chunk cookie, Starbucks where inflation is years ahead.
prices have increased wages havent and my stores barley hanging by a thread 9 people out due to covid we are closing at noon most days now
LMAO LITERALLY reminds me of when sephora fired all their part timers in the beginning of the pandemic and we were literally making record high money according to our ceo
But how else will the execs buy another high end sports car, yacht, or 3rd home to spend one weekend a year in? 

Meanwhile employees aren’t even paid enough to afford a cheap used car on their wages alone.
im pretty sure nation wide there will be some sort of increase in the wage starting in the summer (although some cities have drastic differences in their starting pay)
Okay, so I’m not crazy - prices did definitely go up? I usually pay $4.81 for a venti SCV cold brew and today it was $5.19. I wasn’t sure if maybe the barista rang me up wrong, but seems not.
What if minimum wage is going up in your state? Does Starbucks do anything about that?
Starbucks ain’t getting one god damn cent from me from now on. Idc that I get a partner discount, mark outs are the only thing I’m getting from them.
Sounds like I’m going to Tierra Mia now.
It’s kind of amazing that Starbucks needs how many years of crumb raises and price increases to get us to $15 begrudgingly when you can be a Tarbux barista and make $15 day one. 

Where is the sense in that one?
Welcome to corporate America, where the higher ups make millions while they treat the backbone of the company like ants. It’s ridiculous really
Can’t wait for pissed off regulars🤩🤩
u/cantbestopped124 no u
That’s inflation for you
Customer: "Maybe if you didnt buy these, *grabs new pos payment device*, you could have kept prices the same!!!!"
My coworker: "i have no control over that"
But we ARE getting raises? Swear some y’all mad just to be mad
I know minimum wage increased in canada. don't know why that would hit the US tho. I dunno corporate is money hungry anyways
Wages will be up by Summer 2022. That's what was said in the official statement.
Sweet cream foam is $1.25 extra and I still only got a 60¢ pay increase 🤨
Didn’t Starbucks make like, record profits in 2020-21 despite (because of) the pandemic?
Apparently I recieved a pay raise of 3% which means a 40 hour pay week would net me  $22 extra! LFG
We got a raise (although not a big one) in November I think. That was an advance of the raise we usually get around this time of the year.
I heard there was a raise coming soon but like…where’s it at.
We’re getting our wages increased at the end of the month. Only for 2+ years partners tho
Starbucks hourly wage going up to $17 an hour? Damn I might as well have not gone to nursing school to get paid ten bucks more than a barista
Come on, we all know every barista in each individual store sets the prices.
We had a usually nice and sweet customer tell us “Because I’m paying almost a dollar to just have sugar in my coffee, that’ll cost you a tip today.” Like okay we gave you your 10¢ off for bringing in your cup AND you got your 10% employee discount (our Starbucks is an LS in a grocery store and we work in different departments). 

Sometimes I wish I could muster up the nerve to say something but it’s not worth it for another dollar to split amongst 2-3 people.
That was my same deciding factor also!
They said they were buying back 40 million shares, I think? So, it was actually a few billion $ worth of buybacks, is that right? Or, is that not right?

I did the math on it at the time, and this was my rough math (could be 100% wrong). This was from March 2020:

"Starbucks has done multiple billions of dollars worth of stock buybacks the last several years.  
...one announced last week, 40 million shares at market value, would have been enough to provide all of their workers about $8,000 each."

Was the 40 million shares announced not bought back at market value at the time?

Price changes always happen with launch. However, the most drastic increases are Jan. 1 and July 1. There were a few items ( market dependent) that changed on both Jan. 1, and today.
They have been increasing prices every launch for many years.  It was the case ~7 years ago... probably a good while before then as well.  Why do you think they make such a big deal about launch days hahaha
everyone’s talking about inflation?

shit, better inflate our prices before it hits us too!
Its because of supply chain shortages driving up prices
Price increases are what made me step back and go “I’m spending HOW much on coffee?” Definitely miss my discount and when friends who are current partners buy me coffee, it’s like what I used to pay on my own.
I used to get a venti iced blonde vanilla latte with almondmilk. It was $6.33 until Christmas launch the. It jumped to like $6.90 something. Now I just checked since I haven’t gotten Starbucks since the one I go to has been opening at noon instead of 6am. It is now 7.30. A whole ass dollar in like two months. I’m almost done with this company 😭
Wait, you spend your money at Starbucks?
Good call. I can’t even BELIEVE how much people are willing to pay for our coffee. There’s no reason a simple green tea should be $4.
if they’re truly taxing on unsweetened ice tea, you should report them (if you live in the US). the tea act is still a thing. i worked at mcdonald’s for a while and every drink is tasked EXCEPT unsweetened tea. if they don’t put anything else in there, they legally can’t tax it.
Actually all of the stbux drink should ring at prices that include tax. 
You *should* only see that added to retail or impulse stuff.
This is what I always say. Like, news flash cuz you apparently live under a rock, prices increase every year no matter what. In 2021 inflation was over 6%!! Also $0.22 is a bigger price increase than my 5% wage increase was supposed to be this year…no regrets leaving the company.
Since they got rid of almost all the sugar free syrups, I've stopped going. I have sugar free vanilla at home, and can't justify the amount of sugar in the other drinks. I'll treat myself once in awhile (hellooooo pistachio), but it's definitely gone from a once a week or so thing to maybe once a month.
Its kinda funny cause when the white mocha carmal drizzled cold foam bullshit became popular even a small one was like 6 dollars and all of us workin were like daaammn. A vent is like 8 dollars. 

I was always surprised when id say the total and the customer sounded super chipper. However sometimes they'd go "holy shit" or something along the lines and in the back we are like RIGHT! RIGHT! FINALLY A NORMAL REACTION TO THESE PRICES!
I was shopping last night for some sludge coffee for making at home, and I couldn't believe the cost of even that shit.  And I was at fucking Walmart too!  I can't imagine what coffee costs at, like, a respectable retailer.
Lmao the 86 most likely to unionize stores got the raise in January I’d bet
Where I live it’s one of the better paying jobs. 12 now but 15 come summer. Walmart only pays 11 here. Most fast food is still 8/hr here.
They’re raising the minimum wage in arizona to $15 from what I heard. Should be in effect by 2023
I’ve tried to get hired on at Costco for years but it’s impossible though. I applied to Starbucks because I knew everyone else was trying to get the 15/hour jobs right now but soon we will make that 15$
I used to work at salad and go, just as annoying as sbux u made more there than I did as an SSV at sbux
And it hasn’t even been 10 years since it was something like $3.65. It’s appalling.
[deleted]
Staffing costs aint shit considering there’s stores across the entire country right now closing because of such little staff. They could raise pay for everyone right now and it wouldn’t even be an expense because they have such little staff to begin with
They do it to themselves. Starbucks isn't the only coffee shop, they aren't being forced to order our drinks lol.
For everywhere else, it's 1$ above minimum wage. Starbucks wages have gone up 11% roughly in the past year alone
Damn I’m a barista and I make $16.28
Theyre guna keep doing it until a, lets say grande caramel macchiato, costs $13.24 and then they still wont stop thinking that customers will be ok with it or wont notice it then theyll keep jacking the prices to $13.50...$13.81...$15..etc
😂😂😂😂
18.70 is way better lmso wtf are you still doing here
I mean good on your sm for trying to get you a raise... but she don't seriously expect you to reject 18.70 for 14.50 does she?
what?? explain more if u can
Im curious tho like how did ur manager get u the raise? Thats awesome and i wana kno if it will happen with me if i find a better job and tell my manager about it. Thats awesome for u tho i really hope u get the higher paying job🙂
I heard that too but they have the money now and they’ve had it for years don’t understand why we all have to wait till summer (when i’ll have to quit anyways) to pay us fairly when they’re making major profits because of their price raises and their staffing shortage. They’re literally making the most money they could ever make because they overcharge and are paying skeleton crews to do the job rather than appropriate amounts of staff. It’s fucking disgusting and so insulting I want to quit now
"jump" - that's only like a 6% raise. Inflation was over 5% this year.
That’s what I’ve heard in my area too. We get paid $15 an hour here but heard it could go up $1-2 with minimum wage going up and union efforts happening
SSVs in that area start at $15.24 and baristas start at $12.
Vanilla sweet cream (and all foam variants) alone  went from $1 to $1.25
Noticed someone commented their drink went up $0.22 and my go to vanilla sweet cream cold brew appears to $0.21
Seems to be all them bitches! Syrups . 20/ Sauces .30 / half and half ?
Awesome. Just in time for minimum wage to go up (in Ontario).
$15 minimum company wide
I’m confused on that too. We’re getting a company-wide increase to $15/hour by summer (I think?). My state is increasing to $15/hr by next year so I think I’m gonna start making minimum wage again lmfao.
Yeah, not until summer which makes no sense to begin with and they aren’t even great raises considering tons of stores have each partner working the job of what should be 2-3 partners due to understaffing but refusing to close or limit orders/cafe/etc for over a year now.
which i find dumb. everyone is working hard. everyone should be getting a raise. a good one, and now. but alas
Exactly, when I was being paid 9 /hr it was because I'm an expert in pricing strategy!
Wow that’s so mean.
I don’t remember the details, it was significant enough that I remember doing the buy and them well enough being able to pay us with it.
Edit:
Just googled it again, and you’re right. I was significantly understating the amount they spent. It was somewhere in the ballpark of 2.6 billion.
Dumbest thing I ever did was keep working
Previous poster said wholesale price did not increase. Typically issues with supply are reflected in wholesale purchase price.
There aren't actually shortages in the supply chain.
I did the math on how much I spend on coffee and it was more than my car note. Gonna stop one of these days.
Same, but I get an extra shot and the other day they were like “Your total is $7.78” or something and I’m like damn, that’s an entire dollar more than I was paying over the summer and almost $8 for something that was $6.xx not that long ago. Pretty soon it will be $10. I’ve already been going to Dunkin more often but Starbucks is so convenient because it’s right in town. It’s probably time for me to invest in an espresso machine at home.
Lmao right it’s like smoking up your dealer
Same. Sugar free cinnamon dulce....where'd you go?
Yep. I still can't believe they got rid of the syrups, especially with low carb/keto still being popular. Also, diabetics exist. Once they got rid of SF Hazelnut I cut my trips down to maybe once a month.
White mocha caramel drizzled cold foam bullshit lol 🤣
coffee itself is a fucked up industry. it’s labor intensive and the trees take a long time to have fruit.

coffee should be expensive if it’s fair trade, but most corporations pay the farmers almost nothing and jack up the prices like crazy.
you’d bet correctly. my store organized and threatened with a union and a week later we were being babied.
Wow. Most fast food out here is in the $15 dollar an hour range. Starbucks is by far one of the lowest.
Are we living in the same state 💀
that is actually horrible
exactly! it’s criminal what they’ve done. tell my why my coffee cake was over $3 today???
Right, I was obviously being facetious.  I had just spent some time last night thinking about another story on the evening news about the costs of different consumer goods going up again in the near future, with "supply chain issues" and staffing costs to blame.  Sarcastically... I don't "buy" it anymore.  You can't tell me the costs of our goods are going up for these reasons when the people at the top are continuing to get richer and the companies producing these goods are posting record margins.  Your post here, albeit anecdotal, flies straight in the face of this bullshit soup we continue to be fed by the people that run this country/world.  Apple was just this week declared as the first $3T company in the history of the world... remind me again why the cost of iPhones continues increasing?  I'll give you a hint, it's not because of raising component and wage costs.
Yeah, I don't disagree with that. I'm talking more about the once-in-a-while treat crowd. Example, I had a Mum with her two little girls come in. She was driving a car on its last legs and they weren't exactly dressed to the nines. I could see how excited they were and how much it meant that their mother was dropping $30 on a round of fraps and cake pops. I'm pretty sure she's not rolling in cash raising two little ones. Maybe single? Yeah.

Also if I didn't work here, I'd never come here and pay the prices our customers do, so there's that. If your own workforce can't afford your product, idk capitalism.
agreed

they keep coming because they can afford it.
It is the only coffee shop in a lot of places.
I noticed people talking about different pays, I’m guessing it has to do with the cost of living per area? I don’t know 😕
I don’t understand how they can expect to retain employees with a “raise” like that
I’m in a weird spot, I really enjoy working at Starbucks. Almost doesn’t feel like work. I have my ideal schedule and maintain a good work life balance. If the money was there I wouldn’t even consider the other job.
Sure. The post office pays about 18.70 depending on your job. But their hiring process is a little cumbersome and the office hiring you needs permissions from a higher district office to hire you. Once everything goes through I’ll be promoting to customer.
Over 6% actually
Wow really? And are you guys getting a pay raise this summer too?
what?,????? $1 for that was already ridiculous. wtf
Yeah. I'm in ontario. We already make good money. In the 2.5 years I have been with Starbucks I have gone up $4, unlike the states we get paid pretty well here.
quick question, im a ssv too and i’ve been wondering how to do the supervisor title under the name lol im new to reddit
I’m making $15.50 as a Barista. I was told in a interview at a different store in the same town that the rate was going to go up to $17.50 but I was hired before the new year.
True it’s not 100% fair but I think it’s about time 10 year partners make more than starting baristas. No reason everyone should make the same wage.
You should have just priced yourself higher.
baristas in Illinois get paid $15? is the pay not the same across the board
sorry, the Siren will not allow that
Crazy how brewing at home could literally get you a nicer car
Brew coffee at home! It’s plenty cheap and only takes a minute.
No way, my dealer has a MUCH better sense of humor than Kevin
The skinny mocha was my favorite. I was deeply saddened to see it gone
Oh yeah, you're spot on.  For all the costs involved in coffee production, it's wild that we've "brewed" it down to something that costs next to nothing per serving.  I bought some giant can of some name brand sludge, and the unit cost was probably something like $0.10/cup.  There's a LOTTTTT of hands in the coffee production pot to have to split that $0.10 amongst.  I'm not shy about spending money on good coffee, but we also need to keep a stash of some sludge shit in the house for the automatic drip machine for our Mon-Fri morning grind.
Haha, you should unionize anyway. Show them they can’t manipulate you and that you demand your voice be heard
Paraprofessionals at the schools only make $8.75/hr here, plus they have to pass a test and a background check on their own dime. It’s literally ridiculous. Everyone is super short staffed because what is anyone gonna do with that kind of pay? Not live. Might as well be $2.
Unfortunately this is true in more than one, however I think my state has the distinction of being the only one that outlawed cities raising minimum wage. Living here is a sick joke a lot of the time.
I interviewed at four different Sbux in my area and was offered $12, $12, $12.75, and $14. I'm making $14. Maybe shop around a little?
It is 100% because of cost of living differences. Starbucks does a ton of COL research to decide their prices in each area. They still won’t pay you enough to live, but the goal is to prevent you from being able to afford quitting to look for a better job anyways.
I quit a bank job I was miserable at and took a big pay cut to be a barista at a local coffee shop. I am tight on money but I am happy. I don’t go to work dreading it and have panic attacks 3X a week. You are most definitely right. It’s not always about the money in some cases.
Crossing my fingers for you!
Yes! Baristas will be at $15 and I think SSVs will be at $18 but I’m not 100% sure.
It is. It’s melted whipped cream that you pay for
They did the increase prior to min wage going up, so really we don’t gain much in comparison to min wage going up, so anyone making over minimum wage may not get adjusted up. So someone who was only making minimum wage at the time of the increase might only make just over minimum wage when we get our next paycheques. 

It all depends on if Starbucks adjusts everyone’s pay to be relative to minimum wage.
Tap on your picture next to your comment, and the bottom will say change user flare. Has a couple you can choose there!
Big brain thought, right there.
It's been a few years since I've worked, but I still feel insulted by how low the pay was. They raised the price of a small pike by literal pennies and had people complaining to me for months
[deleted]
Depends on the region. Ottawa area is 12.50 thanks to minimum wage going up.
I think that’s just Chicago. IL just raised the minimum wage to a whole ✨$12/ hr✨ and by 2025 it will be $15. And at that point it’ll need to be much higher than $15. This state is awful.
I’m in upstate NY and I’m making $15.97 - I just started as a barista in November?¿
When I started in Atl two years ago my starting pay was 9.75
Cost of living increases then so does pay. Illinois is a pricey state
Every time I hear the name "Kevin", I just think of the bully from Ed, Edd n Eddy...
My lead told me they are bringing it back.
[deleted]
unfortunately no union leaders have felt the need to get back to me, which has killed momentum at my store.
They just offered me 14.50 when I interviewed
Amazing its the same in south Florida thanks for sharing!
lmao ig instead of extra sweet cream i'll just ask for extra whip
ah ha thank you sm!
Prismatic thinking, even
That’s crazy I knew 5 year shifts making $12.40 that got a raise to $13.40 when they did the major raise last year… that’s when I was like this company sucks donkey 🥜
shifts now get paid $23 in Illinois baristas are at $15 to $14.24 depending on location
yes exactly different stores and states will have different wages
to be fair its at $15 now however its not company wide from what im seeing it seems like they hike up pay in some states and regions but keep places like Florida at low pay to offset the cost of labor
im making $15 starting in northern Illinois
Yea I live in an expensive ass town in Cali and our district is at 15 something to make up for the price of living ( even tho that isn’t enough to cut it here .. like a room for rent is like 1200 a month )
it doenst seem like it has are we allowed to talk about wages with other partners ? I want to see if my store is getting paid the same for the same position store wide
You just made my day ❤️
I havent heard anything about Skinny Mocha coming back
Yes!  Climate change is going to ravage the coffee industry.  You suggest the only truly humane option is to just stop supporting the coffee industry, but do you know if those on the ground in the tea industry face the same plight?  Like, would there be any value to the world in switching from coffee to tea?  If I'm being honest I don't expect I'd actually do that, I've just not done much studying and reading about the tea industry and tea production.
It won’t be quite as sweet since we changed it from 8 pumps of vanilla in the whip to 4 maybe a year and a half ago or so but it’s still not worth it to pay for sweet cream when whip is free
[deleted]
Of course! She didn't say when, just that it is
[deleted]
true, the only exception being something that has vanilla in the recipe already, ex: the vanilla sweet cream cold brew. extra vanilla with no charge
I feel for you :,( shit is roughhhhhhhh
Thanks, looking forward to it!
I JUST got up to 13 dollars.... why the fuck would I raise the price of your latte before I raised my own wage?
“Are you sure that you got it right? It’s supposed dot be $XXX” 
“Did they raise the price on that?”

I. Don’t. Know. They. Don’t. Tell. Us. Things.
They usually up the prices with each seasonal launch from what I've figured out. It's super annoying and I wish they would at least let us know in the weekly updates or something. If we're gonna be the ones to face the ire from customers then we should at least be forewarned.
Yeah. Bacon Gouda is now over 5 bucks at my store. For that tiny little sandwich??? I’ve been telling people to just go to the deli next door.
It wasn't that price yesterday!
“Ma’am I’m a college student working minimum wage do you really think I have any bearing or say in these price changes?”
Likely going to play it off as 'look! We're trying to work with them so they don't unionize but look what they made us do!'
Dang! Good to know, I guess. Just went to check my usual order and it's up by $0.22 USD after tax.

Sorry people are being buttheads. Obviously not your guy's fault.
The cost of Pike went up and I’m elated. Some the drip coffee customers are the worst at our store.
“Well you know before I got out of the board meeting I told Howard, you cheap SOB we need to raise prices!! Then I came straight here to work the register ☺️ “
Omg the customers were like “its a TALL COFFEE, right?!” Yes shut up😭😭😭i didnt raise the price bro i just work here
My response to them is : I don’t know man, I just work here then I shrug 🤷🏻‍♂️ 😂
My favorite? When they *REARRANGE THE ENTIRE POS ORDER SCREEN* on one of the busiest days of the year, rather than doing it a week in advance so people arent *RELEARNING* how to ring in orders while we are slammed. Like how 'tf are these people so stupid??? Come down from your ivory tower and do some actual work assholes.
Why on earth would a customer think that thr barista is responsible?
It usually happens especially during Holiday launch , at least for me it’s been 3 Holiday launches now and it always happens, so you could just tell the customers that and there’s nothing you can do :(
dude this customer always comes in and gets the same thing and the price when up and he was like “you’re putting that in the system wrong bc it’s always $4.80” and i read his order back to him word for word. like why would i overcharge you for no reason 😐
Price changes happen with every launch. The major price changes happen at the new year. This new year upcoming/winter fy22 will be steep hikes on food and sauce based drinks.
Lol me when I got fussed at over the increased price of a chocolate croissant. Sorry, I just work here. 🤷🏾‍♀️
People really should know by now that holiday launch comes with a price increase. Happens every year. My current job is probably going to go up soon too. We have had the same prices since 2019 and they usually go up yearly.
For customers and partners alike, SBUX raises the prices before EVERY Christmas Holiday season, without fail.
We had a lady complain about that today too and of course she told off one of my co-workers. Like lady, we have literally zero control over that, sorry.
What bothers me is that they will, without fail, raise their prices every seasonal launch but a yearly raise is not garunteed. The stores in my area haven't seen a wage raise for something around 5 years until that January pay raise. (Which did nothing because they cut our hours in half right when it went into effect) I was a barista for a few years before I transferred to this area and because of the raises I had received at my previous stores, I was making more than baristas at my new store who had been there for over 10 years. That is so insane to me.
I had a couple of customers ask us if this meant we got raises recently. I could tell they weren't coming from a place of being happy that we did.
Thankfully I'm a partner so I get my drinks for free on the floor. But holy shit it was so expensive before my partner put my numbers in. And it was only a grande.

I remember when they jacked up the espresso shots in August by so many cents and so many ppl got pissed off at it. It was fucking horrible imo.

Now it's even worse bc someone's grande latte cost literally 60¢ more today than yesterday. Like bruh. A 60¢ difference is sm money. I wouldn't be shocked if we started losing customers to other coffee shops.
I mean, they’re in the perfect situation. They know they can do whatever they want because the baristas and shifts will take the beating for any poor decisions they make. Why put in the effort and do the work when someone else is gonna take the fall for you? It’s perfect!
I understand the frustration but not the surprise. They literally change the prices at every launch. Always has been
I told my staff via group chat lol
a regular complained to me today about how his VeNtI Espresso frap is now $6.15
I’ve had like 10 angry customers today bc of that lmao.
I had someone refuse to pay today because it was $0.22 more than it was yesterday so I refused to give her the drink if she wasn’t going to pay. I’ve been a partner for a little while so luckily I knew the price increase might be coming🙃 I know it’s easier said then done, but don’t be afraid to stand your ground. Don’t let the assholes walk all over you. We don’t get paid enough for this shit
My question is WHY STARBUCKS ? So many other local cafe most of which will have better coffee ! Unless u like shitty coffee at high prices ?
Caffeine withdrawal can make some people act like the most Floridian of crackheads, I swear. “My grande Pike is HoW mUcH nOw!!!???” *Starts self-combusting in front of everyone in the store*
Oh yeah, this happened way too much. I never had Starbucks back though. I would just say "oh yeah, corporate tends to raise the prices and never informs anyone. Sorry."
Wait, the prices actually changed today? Someone commented on it (I wouldn’t call her a “regular” but a “comes by somewhat often and makes her presence known so it feels like she’s there a lot” customer) and commented that the prices were higher. I thought it was just her complaining, or since we were in Midtown NYC our sales tax is higher than other places. 

Like, the way she went about it was annoying, but at least I know if anyone says it again that it was true. (Genuine comment; I’ve been using free drinks since I started working here and prior to that as a customer I accepted Starbucks was expensive and something I couldn’t have every day but would just pay without looking at the price so I don’t know what things cost)
I didn’t notice any prices hikes today. I work in Seattle Washington. I know they usually just do the price adjustments for inflation. Crazy how bacon Gouda is more than $5 in some places.
I ordered the same thing the past 5 yeats i moved to the us and everytime i saw a higher price i would freeze for like 2 seconds, looking confused.
Sigh. Even yesterday someone asked me for both a stopper and a sleeve. I'm like, "sure! Lemme grab those". They proceed to complain that WE are skimping them on this stuff while they're paying for their five dollar latte.

"Hey, that's not our call. Starbucks makes the rules"

They proceed to complain more. Why. Why, y'all.
I found this out yesterday morning.  The guy was nice about it, but I had to apologize so much for the price going up. I cant believe a large drink is $6+ now, with venti pike being $3+
I was so sad I wanted Starbucks after class but they closed at 1 p.m due to short staffing :/
It would make sense though, that if the employees are getting universal raises that the price would increase as well
Back in 2006 or 2007 I was chewed out by my fellow Barista's mother for a $0.01, voter approved sales tax increase.  Oh, and if I remember correctly, the revenue from that $0.01 sales tax increase was to help with the budget of our local firefighters.
So glad to see no one else was told. Found out from my barista being questioned by a custy. Happy days.
Thank the gods we got that 5% pay raise in October, amirit?!
Hi, if you are interested you can check this article: [https://www.theistanbulchronicle.com/post/even-with-drastic-increases-in-price-people-continue-to-buy-starbucks-drinks](https://www.theistanbulchronicle.com/post/even-with-drastic-increases-in-price-people-continue-to-buy-starbucks-drinks)
I hit buttons. Say numbers.
None of our signage for the holiday launch came so none of the prices are gonna match the previous green board. This will be fun 🙄
Specifically, there is usually a price increase coinciding with holiday launch. The other launches don't typically have much in the way of price changes (maybe one or two items, but not the across the board of holiday).

I think last year they pushed the price increase back a launch or two.
someone on here called the bacon gouda a single slider and now I can’t unsee it. It’s such a rip off
When In-N-Out is literally down the street and it’s like $8.10 for a double double meal while here it’s $5 for the drink alone
It's sad because bacon goudas usually sell out too

Wouldn't really put it past people that pay $6-7 for coffee so...
Went to get an impossible sandwich today (they’re pretty much the only thing I still get there, aside from the occasional ridiculous coffee milkshake) and it was $5.50. I’m a little heartbroken, honestly.
"YESTERDAY'S PRICE IS NOT TODAY'S PRICE"

\- Fat Joe, and starbucks
Do these people buy gas? Just wondering.
Let them. I’ll gladly pay extra for my drink if it means you guys don’t get shafted on pay and benefits.
This is 100% the current strategy. They've realized that they're losing. And to prevent a union (i.e. total loss), they're giving some things to partners to help quell the resistance. But the goal is to take a short term loss for a long term win - by trying to convince the general public that "greedy" pro-union partners are the reason for price increases. If they successfully associate unions with higher prices, public opinion turns and corporate regains power. Also the frustration from the prive increase will be directed at the lowest level partners, so corporate can "save the day by not having to raise prices anymore, if only that union nonsense would stop."
I got a drip coffee the other day and then realized I could get my usual "fancy" drink for close to the same price! Like 3.50. (I was kinda shocked cause last time I got drip it was like $2 or something like that but ya know, inflation...) 😩

Curious, why are drip customers so crabby?

Shoot me now
Howard? He isn't at the board meetings anymore. Which board meeting did you go to?
Customers simultaneously treat us like minimum wage garbage and somehow also think we have a lot more power than a minimum wage would suggest. It's insane, actually.

These people do not understand. I DONT KNOW YOU, why would I target you of all people for a price change 😭😭
Half the company is new hires, the surprise isn't... surprising.   To me at least. For me personally, that just wasn't a pattern I noticed because I never pay for anything.
Our customers buy sugar milk with a splash of coffee lmao.
Right! A venti coffee when I got hired was 2.92 and now a grande is 2.92. Even before the launch a TALL pumpkin spice was 5 dollars... like what the hell starbucks.
I went to my local store around 11am-ish on Sunday. They closed at 9am due to the staff shortage. I’m
I’m 100% here for people leaving to find employment with a livable wage or at least where they won’t deal with trash working conditions.
It doesn't make sense because they made enough to pay me this a decade ago. The price increased because they want it to, not because we got 50 cents.
And sometimes I can barely do that! 😩

Bacon Gouda is a single slider but instead of a burger it's a homogeneous egg patty. 

FOR 5 DOLLARS
I’m just a customer but I had to comment - 

My 8 year old now wants me to order her TWO bacon Goudas! No way kid.
Don't even get me started on the Impossible Sandwich that vegan people can't even eat.
It's that small? Lol
Burger King has a pretty solid Impossible Sandwich if there’s one near your area. It doesn’t have the sausage-y texture but it’s good nonetheless imo
Gas is an absolute crap shoot. Where I live it could.be $2.50 or it could be $3.50. Give or take like 75 cents in either direction because honestly I think they spin a wheel and let it choose.
Thank you but it's a false narrative. Having looked at their earnings report for the last year they could easily pay everyone 24$ a hour and still be very profitable. But instead they want to do more stock buybacks with their extra money instead of helping us out.
Did you go to the party? Entirely about union- busting, especially their toxic "green thread"
I didn't even know about the union stuff but because I'm on this sub a lot, I've learned a lot more about your side of things.. 🧐
And I don't see how making customers even worse to us helps further that goal. If anything it only further, for lack of a better term, radicalizes us
The majority of them are super old, so anything changing makes them mad.
I don’t know why they are crabby, they usually are very impatient. We occasionally run out of brewed coffee, and they don’t like to wait. A lot of customers also order black coffee then ask for cream or sugar at the hand off. Order cream and sugar with your coffee and ask for it on the side. The condiment bar is not coming back.

Said customer then takes the pike to the trash and dumps HOT coffee into the trash can. Ask for room if you want room in the cup.
Can I get a black coffee?

At the window - can I get cream and sugar please?

💀
Still better than the people who ask for a pokes peak. In my store the people who call the dark roast “bold” are the most curmudgeonly old men who go out of their way to make people as miserable as they are.
That's how you can tell who has and hasn't worked service jobs I guess.
I work in sales and we are empowered to tell people mistreating us to pound sand. I wish yall could do the same.
Right like I’m gonna overcharge this guy and pocket the extra quarter!
That’s fair
Haha
“Makes sense” meaning, theyd rather raise the cost to customers than cut their own salary
throughout the day i get less and less coherent. by the time I'm tripping over my words like someone pushed me down the stairs like a slinky, then I know it's time to go home
One time I turned around to greet a customer whose order I had not taken and said, very confidently, “do you need anything else?”
Luckily our SM figured out that they sent our signage to another store so the issue was resolved quickly for once lmaoo
Yeah and I’ve had people order it where they take off the egg and the meat on it 🤡 like are you seriously gonna pay 5+ dollars for bread and cheese wtf
You gotta hit 'em with the "We have Bacon Gouda at home!"
Really? I really like it, but I agree, I only spend stars on that one.
Same in Ohio. Eek
Corporates can pay better with little to no price-hike. It’s the small biz that needs these kind of adjustments for wages. This is definitely about adjusting for inflation in order to maintain certain corporate practices.
Lol sounds like the airline I work for
Well, acting intelligently has never really been Starbucks corporate's forte.
Ah. Interesting bc my husband made a recent comment about how "morning coffee pot routine" ppl tend to be Boomers or GenX and I was like not necessarily.. but maybe there is a lot of truth to that 🤔

Side note.. I wish they had which roast was available as drip in the mobile app.. instead of calling the store ahead of time to find out lol. Would this be feasible I wonder?
Ohh I get it. I wasn't sure about the condiment bar.. I figured it would be back by now 😩

Once I asked for room and they did add-ins for me. Sadly it wasn't enough cream (idk how to specify that) but yeah, dumping it is so rude!!

Last time I had to wait for drip and asked how long it would be. They said about 3 minutes, which I was impressed! Then she personally gave it to me 😍

I'd say the only thing that really bugs me is when the mobile order wait time is WAY off and I end up standing there for 10 minutes.. but I guess you guys don't have much control over that!
Sorry I misunderstood. But yeah of course. Kevin tried to get like 50 million dollar bonus not to long ago but we can't pay rent. Love it here lol.
Haha me too! “Thinks fur cheesing sturbucks wha cin ah git fur ya?” I promise I’m not drunk. I’ve just been here since 5am.
I ALWAYS re-greet customers that are standing around waiting for the food I just put in the oven. 

"Hi! Good morning! What can I get started for..... you....."
You don’t know how many times I’ve taken payment at DT and said “have a great day!” And they’re like “I haven’t gotten my drink yet” oh…
A couple years ago FedEx dropped our Holiday promo set to the nearby licensed store and our box to them. It took me a hot minute to realize that NOTHING looked right. When I finally got it all boxed back up and over to the licensed store, their manager was equally confused as she had just opened up her set as well.
I made my kids their own “Starbucks” protein boxes…for like, $2 a box MAYBE
It might be, but there's a lot of issues they need to sort with the app as is. If it's not morning, just assume they only have pike. They can do a pour over of anything they have in the store at any time though. If you want to be nice to the barista, don't do it in the drive through though.
We don’t have any control over the estimated wait times for mobiles. We have no control over the amount or types of drinks ordered. Some take longer than others, plus that person is also making cafe and delivery orders. Depending on the time of day they are also making drive thru orders alone.

They changed the way we measure cream, it goes by 1/4inch increments now which may help.

Edit: Also, I don’t mind when people ask if I’m close to their order yet, if I can I just make it before the other mobiles in front of it.
(Customer orders like 3 drinks and a pastry)  


Me: (looking at clock on POS which so happens to be next to the total) "That'll be 3:30....wait a minute"
Thanks for the info! 

The inches thing may help.

Oh ok, I always hate bothering them if I am waiting for the mobile order I placed 10-15 mins ago... 😩 so thank you 🙂
# Hello Partners, Guests, and Everyone Reading,

I came into my shift realizing launch day is here and read the weekly update. Why is this significant? Starbucks has raised their prices again much like every other launch... A.K.A. ***Price Gouging***.  


I think this particular launch price gouge was a bit more significant than the rest of them since we got the weekly update and watched a video of Schultz speaking on company issues last week. The weekly update mentioned that we would be *receiving $15 wage increases this summer*.  


\>>>(I am in New York State and hired at $15 last year February; this does not mean anything for me. For other partners this means a lot, which will be very significant point in this post from here.)  


I find this price gouging issue absolutely insane because other large-scale companies such as McDonald's offers this wage or higher as a starter (\*information from literally driving by the big M window to see fliers of being hired for $16 last year) with their food/drinks being *SIGNIFICANTLY* cheaper than ours. My point is that **Starbucks could've easily afforded the $15 wage increase over a year ago**, especially when partners were paid less than me. It is ridiculous that almost everything has an upcharge and that ONE DRINK could be totaled to roughly $10.

To our Partners; Think about how many orders you take in drive-thru and try to imagine the total cost of every order you've taken within an hour. Now think about how much \*you\* are paid by the hour. Doesn't add up does it?  


Why are the drink prices increasing? This has been the 3rd time or so this year (from what I remember) of item price increases when **NOTHING** has changed about the item.  


Let's be real here; This is not a supply issue, this is a ***PRICE GOUGING ISSUE.***

***The Siren needs to be paying our partners appropriately and to respect the integrity of their business and prices to our guests.***
The biggest complaint I have is honestly just giving us a heads up that prices are going up again so we are aware before hand.  Every time we learn about price increases when a customer brings it up while ordering
i agree that our prices are too high and we aren’t being paid enough etc etc



….... but i don’t think you know what price gouging is
When I look at the cost of drinks at other coffee chains or even independent coffee shops in my area the prices are honestly very similar. A 16 ounce mocha in Issaquah costs about 6 dollars *everywhere*. You can honestly find places even more expensive than Starbucks in Seattle. I think a major aspect of Starbucks and coffee in general people tend to forget is coffee is an actual crop, and as such there is a finite amount of it in existence and the cost of the crop depends on a myriad of factors. 

The elephant in the room is that coffee is very susceptible to climate change as it cannot be grown just anywhere. Coffee plants require a specific combination of daytime and nighttime temperature, humidity, soil acidity etc. This is why you find these plants mostly at elevation in the tropics. The area in which coffee can be grown is quite literally slowly shrinking. And when you look at coffee output year over year we are already starting to see a significant stall in production in most growing regions. In fact Brazil is pretty much the sole reason why global output is stalling instead of shrinking. Depending on whether you go by crop year or coffee year their output increased 2-18% from 2019 to 2020 when almost all regions and countries across the board saw declines. Even looking back at 2017 compared to now we can see a shrink in output from Mexico, Central America, Asia, and Oceania. South America is the only region with noticeable growth but it's all just from Brazil. And this past summer Brazil was hit with one of the worst frosts in 40 years damaging millions of bags worth of coffee, which may take up to 3 years for Brazil to recover from. The cost of coffee will almost never naturally come back down again to anything remotely cheap. Any place or company selling dirt cheap coffee products is balancing it with child/slave labor, extremely low wages for farmers, plant workers etc.
I worked for Starbucks for a year, and the last 4 months have been my breaking point that I left. Since starting in 2021 every launch was a 10¢ increase. This one is the worst yet. 
I feel bad for the partners that have no control, but will deal with angry customers over this.
Oh Starbucks. I mainly see the customers will tip even less now. It’s crazy that my 8 years at Starbucks, at 4 different stores, tips were $1.25 an hour my first year, and .68 cents an hour my last year at a busy drive-thru.

Luckily I’m now at a local coffee shop, where tips are $8-$10 per hour, and there’s less customers and customizations! Our coffee is also more expensive, it’s still crazy the differences are with fast food coffee vs. a chill local coffee hub.
Oh, I've seen the prices go up every launch for the past couple years or so. It's crazy. Not looking to finding out how much my chai is tomorrow.
[deleted]
this is honestly just so ridiculous and im so sick of it. you keep talking about how you’re raising the prices for your products so that you can pay your employees more when there are so many fast food chains that have been doing that (without residing the prices of their products) since the beginning. 

also to all the partners out there,, how many people have complained about the new prices to you so far? i have a regular that complained she has to pay more for her frap. and then earlier this week i had an elder woman complain about paying 0.80 cents to have hazelnut in her latte. she wanted to go back and fourth with me saying thats never happened before but i know damn well that isnt true. she argued with me at post and then again at the window
We automatically got bumped to $13, but no word on when anyone would be getting it. If i dont get it by the end of the summer, me and many others are out.
My pre-Covid Venti pike was $2.87 with tax.  It is now something like ~$3.50!  I am def brewing at home more these days and only go to Starbucks if I’m out of town.  That’s a hefty increase within a short period of time.
i wouldn’t say NOTHING has changed about the products… the sandwiches keep getting smaller……
also who the f decided that we need to charge to blend drinks that aren’t blended by standard??? that’s like adding an extra charge to foam up the VSC :(
I see a lot of comments talking about inflation and supply chain issues, but no mention of Starbucks profits increasing over 30% and their ceo getting a 39% raise to $20m+. Definitely not corporate greed /s
But how else are we (Starbucks) able to afford a 40% raise for Kevin Johnson? /s
This is sooo important!! And on top of the lack of pay we are receiving, but our hours being cut for no reason and having to fight for full hours. Customers are pissed at us for taking longer but we have less people on the floor, and are expected to pick up extra work because they don’t want to give us hours.
i hate having to explain to a regular that their very simple order of extra water chai is going to be almost 40¢ more for no reason whatsoever.
Op your overall point is a good one and it needs to be discussed that Starbucks seems to push price increases every time they even talk about raising wages when they literally could pay every barista in America $20 an hour and eat it from just the CEO's pay...

But this is not "price gouging." That's a very specific, very serious accusation that doesn't apply to a coffee shop raising prices.
If you’re already at $15 you’ll get anywhere from 3-7% raise depending on how long you’ve worked at bux. 

But yeah, Starbucks could’ve afford it long ago.
I don't think this is what price gouging means
Price gouging is only really necessities. Starbucks is not a necessity. The prices are ridiculous, but everyone can live without it. Yes, we should be paid better.
I quite going to Starbucks several months ago because of their extreme price gouging and declining customer service. I don’t regret it. I’ve been thinking about buying an espresso machine but honestly I don’t miss drinking coffee. I feel better overall for breaking the caffeine and sugar high habit. My bank account is healthier too. To me Starbucks has become insatiably greedy while their quality and customer service has declined Their employees decision to unionize is karma coming full circle.
This post is all over the place. This isn’t price gouging and if it were, that’s an issue that affects customers. What does that have to do with what we are paid?
Just a reminder to everyone mentioning the actual cost of the coffee beans as a reason this is happening that the coffee and espresso shots by themselves (as in black nothing in them) are actually one of THE MOST profitable things that Starbucks sells if not the most when I last looked into it (which wasn’t that recently but also the coffee prices haven’t raised outside of the general trend and I don’t know why that data would be incorrect now) The price of their coffee is not the main concern. It’s all the other costs.
People think whenever they're running a business that it's better to pull their pice up 
All that's going to do is put your costumers  in
 a mad mod  from here your  costumers won't come as often as the use to they'll just go somewhere else to get it cheaper
Thought it would also be fun to add that food and drinks used to be free once a day REGARDLESS if you worked a shift DURING THE PANDEMIC.

Then they changed it to 30 minutes before or after or during a shift.

But people still want to say "It's not about price gouging" or "its our supply" 🙄🙄🙄
How is that price gouging? Inflation has prices increasing on everything and Starbucks latest increase is in the same ballpark as everything else.
(Food for thought)☝️The cheaper the price more customers you have  and the more money you'll 
have
Prices in my area didn’t seem to increase, unless it was for modifiers - I changed the signage over for launch last night and main beverages and food items had the same listed prices
jsuk the price raises will affect u even if ur at $15 already. its up to $15 or 3%, whichever is higher.
Yea just noticed this... Cool my nitro is almost $6. Once it crosses that threshold I'm out. That's just too expensive, and I can just brew stuff at home.
Just look at the daily numbers. Tells you exactly how much income there is per half hour. You have to account for things other than just pay cost. Shit is expensive.
I agree with your argument but you should look up the definition of price gauging because what you’re describing is not it
I can’t morally give a man a single shot of nasty espresso and charge him 2.96 for it. That’s simply too damn much
Anyone in this thread who believes Starbucks isn't price gouging is drunk from the cold brew kool-aid.
I just stopped buying Starbucks.  Way too expensive and now I don’t complain about any increases because I don’t see them.  Problem solved.  Bought a Jura for home.  Pays for itself in less than a year
