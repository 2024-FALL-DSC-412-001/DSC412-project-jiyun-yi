Also we struggle with a shortage of coworkers and a huge low motivation which causes to many of our co-workers to call in sick. The consequence of this is having only one barista on a Sunday morning for a whole store, taking care of the opening, bar, lobby, and defrosting until the next shift arrives. We also have some stores which have become a standard to manage for one barista only, taking shifts until 11 pm because they have to do closing alone. We've asked many times to the Management for new coworkers and fair work environment, but after 6 months working here nothing has changed. The average of a barista working here is 4 months, all of them go to other places where they get better paid.

"I asked this question awhile back but got downvoted a ton, but like if your in a union I assume you can’t cover shifts at a different store? And if you need to transfer, do you leave the union? If someone is a crappy partner who doesn’t show up, are they immune from being fired? I don’t work at SBUX anymore but I think those are valid questions out of curiosity. The fact SBUX has gone through all these steps means they are freaked out by it, that video was creepy. They were like “this is your decision! But DONT DO IT, because we want you to have a voice”. Like, partners do have a voice and this is what they want. Its also insulting as fuck to the partners. Their biggest talking points were “you’ll have to pay a union due” which is basically saying they acknowledge they pay you shit as it is so losing that $20 a month is a good portion of your paycheck. And did that Tatiana lady fill out her own secret ballot on camera and submit her official ballot that your not supposed to talk about unless it’s persuading partners to vote no? This is so fucked.

And I’m not super knowledgeable on unions in general, but if Starbucks has the cash for lawyers and propaganda are they going to legally retaliate and make life (even more of) hell. Watching that video still bothers me, they were being “nice” but with a hard slant towards NO obviously. If this gets voted yes, are they gonna come down hard? How do strikes even work, would the employees be against the union or against Starbucks. Are scabs just partners from different stores that cover those shifts while they picket? How can I help support people by educating them on the pros and why good leadership is so necessary. I’m worried there’s actors working undercover to spread misinformation who you wouldn’t assume were.

"But I think OPs problem isn't actually MO&P, it's that we're not staffed to serve it adequately while also giving good service to our lobby customers. We're forced, via metrics and customer abuse, to prioritize MO&P over engaging customers that choose to come in. When we have to make the choice on what to shut off to make the wait time even marginally manageable, MO&P is the first because it's uncontrollable. Drive is limited to how many cars can be in line. Lobby is limited to how fast your front ringers can ring. MO&P, as I experienced this morning, can send us 4 orders of 15+ items within 30 seconds, faster than anyone could ring up. And this was alongside the 20 other smaller orders that came in within the minute. We can't keep up with that volume of service without getting abused, either by customers waiting or the performance expected of us.

"If you like the service, I'd really recommend reaching out to corporate and advocating for better staffing at your local stores, especially if you've noticed they've had to shut down their MO&P service. Most of us don't hate MO&P entirely, we're just not being equipped to keep up with it.

"From the bottom of my heart, fuck you. I’ve been trying to get my hands on these stupid Halloween cups because I’m a huge sucker for Halloween and it’s my favorite holiday. I didn’t even know that Starbucks makes Halloween cups until this year because Karen wipes out all of the merchandise every launch so I never get to see the collections at any of the stores. I’m from the Bay Area and every store here is wiped out and has been for the past week. Every single one. I found one for a decent price online (a couple of dollars above the normal retail price in store) and made the person an offer. A couple minutes later they reject my offer and double the price! Like wtf! I asked her why and she said that she had the wrong price listed. It’s impossible to get any cups for these launches unless you pay 2-4x the price.

"As an employee, I’ll tell you that we get very little of the more popular cups. That’s why they are popular. And oftentimes, a lot of them are gone within a few minutes of being out on the shelf (and they are usually bought by the employees.) I remember I bought one of the summer launch blue studded cups and there were only 6 (i was in my store with my bf when the RP order was unpacked). I bought one, my bf bought one, a coworker bought one, and a few minutes later a customer came in and bought two, so within 5 mins there was only 1/6 left.

"Starbucks will typically replenish the supply to some stores, but stores won’t know what their getting. Typically the larger stores with more merchandise will get more. I’d recommend making friends with the staff. Ask if they could call or email you when the items are back in stock. Also, start asking ahead of time about the next holiday launch so you can show up on the first day. Or just plan to go to Starbucks daily in the morning (buy something or not) to see if there’s anything new.
