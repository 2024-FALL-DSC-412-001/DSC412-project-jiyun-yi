"Right, I was obviously being facetious.  I had just spent some time last night thinking about another story on the evening news about the costs of different consumer goods going up again in the near future, with ""supply chain issues"" and staffing costs to blame.  Sarcastically... I don't ""buy"" it anymore.  You can't tell me the costs of our goods are going up for these reasons when the people at the top are continuing to get richer and the companies producing these goods are posting record margins.  Your post here, albeit anecdotal, flies straight in the face of this bullshit soup we continue to be fed by the people that run this country/world.  Apple was just this week declared as the first $3T company in the history of the world... remind me again why the cost of iPhones continues increasing?  I'll give you a hint, it's not because of raising component and wage costs.

"When I look at the cost of drinks at other coffee chains or even independent coffee shops in my area the prices are honestly very similar. A 16 ounce mocha in Issaquah costs about 6 dollars *everywhere*. You can honestly find places even more expensive than Starbucks in Seattle. I think a major aspect of Starbucks and coffee in general people tend to forget is coffee is an actual crop, and as such there is a finite amount of it in existence and the cost of the crop depends on a myriad of factors. 
",0.058750000000000004

"The elephant in the room is that coffee is very susceptible to climate change as it cannot be grown just anywhere. Coffee plants require a specific combination of daytime and nighttime temperature, humidity, soil acidity etc. This is why you find these plants mostly at elevation in the tropics. The area in which coffee can be grown is quite literally slowly shrinking. And when you look at coffee output year over year we are already starting to see a significant stall in production in most growing regions. In fact Brazil is pretty much the sole reason why global output is stalling instead of shrinking. Depending on whether you go by crop year or coffee year their output increased 2-18% from 2019 to 2020 when almost all regions and countries across the board saw declines. Even looking back at 2017 compared to now we can see a shrink in output from Mexico, Central America, Asia, and Oceania. South America is the only region with noticeable growth but it's all just from Brazil. And this past summer Brazil was hit with one of the worst frosts in 40 years damaging millions of bags worth of coffee, which may take up to 3 years for Brazil to recover from. The cost of coffee will almost never naturally come back down again to anything remotely cheap. Any place or company selling dirt cheap coffee products is balancing it with child/slave labor, extremely low wages for farmers, plant workers etc.
