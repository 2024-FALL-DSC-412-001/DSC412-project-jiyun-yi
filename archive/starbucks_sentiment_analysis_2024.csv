"It genuinely doesn’t make sense to me, considering how Starbucks does its labor as well. It’s not like a retail store where we all get 40 hours a week(but it does depend on location). There’s no such thing as “full time” or “part time” here, we’re all just partners and get full benefits as long as we work 20 hours a week and that’s what most of us get is 15-25 hours a week. So they have substantially shorter labor costs than most other businesses and labor is one of the highest costs for a company, and the margin they make per drink is pretty damn high. The more I look into capitalism, the less sense it makes to me. Don’t get me wrong I’m all for making a profit(I have my own video editing business I do full time and Starbucks is my side gig for benefits), but the AMOUNT of profit a company has to make to consider it their “bottom line” is just… stupid.

I've also worked as a barista and SM for many years at Starbucks and certainly wasn't directing my dissatisfaction to you or any store level barista.

"Toddy, the company that makes Starbucks (and other coffee shops) cold brew containers has cheaper at-home versions of their brewers. But, these aren't required. You can use a french press. Grind your beans to coarse ground, put in the french press, pour cold water, and then put that in the fridge for about 20 hours and then plunge the next day. You have great cold brew.

"The trick about having good cold brew at home is making sure you choose the right roast type and further right blend. Not all roast levels work for cold brew. Dark roasts, or medium-dark tend to work better. But, even then, sometimes the blend or origin of the beans won't have a great flavor when brewed cold brew. But, going through this process just connects you with your coffee more which I always reccomend people do anyways.
