Now 300 stars are required for the same drink and pastry or 50% more. FIFTY percent is WAY more than inflation.

I told them I was a former employee and just had to let them know hey, maybe you have a bad batch? The manager said they would continue using it until it was finished.

"[Starbucks Workers United](https://sbworkersunited.org/new-page-2) is where you can go to find out more about forming a union. This fact alone makes it seem less scary: only 30% of the store has to sign a card to hold a vote. Every single store in the country has at least 1/3rd of the staff who are pro-union enough to at least hold a vote. If enough stores file to hold their vote around the same time it means they can't hyperfocus and send all of their corporate goons to any one location to bully the employees there. It can be done and it has to be done if anything will change. Starbucks employees on average are very open minded and people-oriented, and this means that we all mostly stand together ideologically already. The rest is just paperwork.

They told me to take a 10, go outside and then come back and “tell us what your decision is.” Like they were literally trying to get me to quit on the spot I guess? At that moment I realized holy shit I’m in a cult. The next time I saw my DM she wrote me up during my PDD for completely fabricated things. Like specific dates that we had conversations that I was on vacation…specific dates that my store was dirty when jokes on her I had photos of my entire store because we just had the tile regrouted and I had to send photos to the contractor. Literally 1 yr prior to that I was the MOQ. I drove home, filed for a mental health LOA, wrote a huge ass manifesto that I sent to corporate and they launched an investigation. I got the CA revoked but I was SO fucking done. I emptied my vacation and sick banks and GTFO.

Yeah they brought back coffee master program big whoop.  They only brought it back after unions took off.  It’s not a sustaining job anymore and it’s corporates fault.  All they had to do is listen to what their partners wanted and they flat out refuse.  So I will gladly stand by and watch the mighty fall.  I hope more stores and partners push to unionize.
